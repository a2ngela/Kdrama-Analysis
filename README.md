# Kdrama-Analysis
This project explores data from the top 250 Korean dramas on MyDramaList (as of January 2023) using two approaches:
- Project 2: An R Markdown report featuring data cleaning, summary statistics, and visualizations to uncover trends in drama ratings, episode count, duration, and airing days.
- Project 3: An interactive Shiny web application that allows users to explore the dataset dynamically by selecting variables, filtering by rating, customizing graph colors, and viewing descriptive statistics.
